PlasmaPy: Beginning a Community Python Package for Plasma Physics
-----------------------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   PlasmaPy is a new openly-developed community Python package for
   plasma physics. This package strives to provide the core
   functionality that is needed to foster the creation of a fully open
   source Python ecosystem for laboratory, heliospheric, and
   astrophysical plasmas.  After describing the functionality of our
   first release and plans for future development, we will discuss the
   extensive lessons we have learned while starting an open source
   project for a large scientific community.  

.. class:: keywords

   plasma physics, open source, Python

Introduction
------------

I didn't like unstable eigenfunctions at first, but then they grew on
me.
